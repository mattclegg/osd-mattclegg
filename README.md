# osd-mattclegg #
====================

## Features
* Fetch and display all subpages' titles, truncated after 20 characters but won't split in the middle of a word (unless your first word is more then 20 characters)

* If present shows a very small circular thumbnail-version of the pages/posts 'featured image' next to the title.

* Each level has the ability to be sorted by title in ascending and descending order by the user -providing the level has more then 1 title.

* The user can also expand or collapse each level.

All this is possible without reconnecting to the server after the page has been loaded!!
